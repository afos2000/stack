# üöÄ GitOps and DevOps Toolkit üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to our GitOps and DevOps Toolkit repository! This toolkit contains essential components to streamline your GitOps processes and enhance your DevOps practices. Below, we'll walk you through the stack description, provide an overview of the key deployments, and demonstrate how each component contributes to your development and deployment workflows.

## Stack Description

Our stack comprises various tools and utilities tailored to facilitate GitOps practices in synergy with DevOps methodologies. Here's a breakdown of the components included:

### Continuous Deployment (CD): Argocd
