### Disabled: original mlflow Ingress moved here to avoid conflicting hostname ownership with argocd
### If you want the mlflow route to be served under the same hostname, consolidate into the argocd ingress
### or ensure both ingresses are in the same namespace and have identical ngrok traffic-policy + pooling annotations.
